#### what google from its quest to studying teams
##### project aristotle's researchers:
* the researchers scrutinized the composition of groups inside Google:
**  How often did teammates socialize outside the office
** Did they have the same hobbies?
** Were their educational backgrounds similar?
** Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy?
* They drew diagrams showing which teams had overlapping memberships and which groups had exceeded their departments’ goals
* They studied how long teams stuck together and if gender balance seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.
* **it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.**
* Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.
* **which norms were the ones that successful teams shared?**
* The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. 
* The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
* they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared:
** First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
** Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
* Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ 
* ‘‘conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety
* research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success
* There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability.
* But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.
* the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.
* be fully present at work, to feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations
* Project Aristotle has encouraged emotional conversations and discussions of norms among people who might otherwise be uncomfortable talking about how they feel.
* By putting things like empathy and sensitivity into charts and data reports, it makes them easier to talk about, It’s easier to talk about our feelings when we can point to a number.
* In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
* Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention, Don’t underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language.
