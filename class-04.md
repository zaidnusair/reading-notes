#### links
* links are created using the `<a>` tag.
* the format is`<a href="www.abc.com:>abc</a>` where abc between the tags will be linked to the site.
* its used to help people navigate to *other sites* (absulote URL) or *local pages* (relative URL) while keeping the page looking organiszed and simple.
* depending on the site structure; linking to a **relative URL** can be tricky.
* the structure goes as follows:
** grandparent folder (considered parent for parent folder)
*** parent folder
**** child folder
***** grandchild folder
- the format is `<a href="grandparent/parent/child/gradnchild.html>grandchild page</a>`
* use target to open link in a new window.

#### layout
* its controlling where each element sits on the page.
* the goal is making the profile more attractive.
* each html element has its own box, it can be either *block-level* or *inline* box.
* block-level element starts one a new line, while inline elemnts dlow between surrounding text.
* if one block-level element sits inside another, the outer box is known as the *parent* or *containing* element.
* positioning schemes allow you to control the layout of the page:
** normal flow
** relative positioning
** absolute positioning
* box offset lets you indicate where the box should be positioned:
** fixed positioning
** floating positioning
* z-index lets you control which box appearse on top.





#### functions, methods and objects
* they are used to organise code.
* a function lets you group a series of statements toghether to perform a specific task. you can use it for diiferent pasrt of the script and resuse it. ` function functionName(){ code }`
* you **declare** a function usng the `function` keyword.
* you **name** a fuction after you declare it ` function functionName()`
* the **statement** that performs the task sit in a code block inside curly braces `{statement}`
* to excute the function you need to **call the function** , `function name();`
* sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task. in this case you give the function *parameters* when you declare it. inside the parathasise they act as variables.
* when you call a function that has *parameter*, you specify the value it should use in the parentheses. that follow its name. these values are called **arguments** and they can be provided as values or variables.
* some functions **return** information to the code that called them.
* functions can return mutiple values using *array*.







#### pair programming
* pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.
* pair programming commonly involves two roles: 
1. the Driver: the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
2. the Navigator: uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
* reasons for pair programming:
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
