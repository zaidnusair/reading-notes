#### How the web works 
* You connect to the web through your ISP. 
* When visiting a website, the browser will first connect to a DNS server. 
* The DNS tells your computer the IP address associated with the requisted domain name.
* The IP that the DNS returns to your computer allows the browser to cotact the web server that hosts the website rquisted.
* The web server then sends the page you requisted back to your web browser.

#### Structure 
```
<html>
<body>
<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
the page. And if the page is a long one it might
be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
you follow the structure of what is being written.
There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
headings).</p>
<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
* html uses tags, they usually come in pairs; and openning tag and a closing tag.

#### Extra Markup
* *doctypes* tell browsers whcih version of HTML is being used.
* use `<!--and-->` markers to add comments to your code.
* you can identify elemnts using *id* and *class* attributes.
* you can group *block-level* and *inline elements* together using `<div>` and `<span>`.
* use *escape charechters* to include special charechters in your page.

#### HTML5 layout
* *HTML5* introduces a new set of elemnts that allow you to devide up the parts of a page.
* these elements provide clearer code, insteade of using `<dev>` elements.
* for some older browsers you need to be told which elements are *block-level* elements.
* examples of said elements: `<header> <footer> <nav> <article> <aside> <section> <hgroup> <a>` and others.

#### Process and Design
##### How your website should look:
* you design a site accourding to your targeted audience, and reasons of visiting and their goal of visiting your website.
* you need their experience to be as good as possible, therefore they should be provided with a clear and visible information that will help them navigate the site.
* how often is your site being visited? some sites benifit from being updated regualry.

##### Organising Information:
* **Site Maps**: a diagram of the basic elements that your site will contain and how they connect together.
* **Wireframes**: a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of the website.

##### Design:
* the aim of any visiual design is to communicate.
* organising and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.
* you can use contrast to creat a **visual hierarchy** that across your key message and helps users find what they're looking for.
* you can also use *grouping* and *similarity* to make it easier to comprehend.

#### The ABC of programming
##### what is a script ?
a script is much like a recipe, its a series of instruction that a computer follows to achieve a goal.


##### how to write a script?
1. define the goal.

2. design the script.
  ** break each task into a sequance of steps. sketch the design using a flowchart.

3. code each step.
  ** computers dont approach tasks like humans. instructions must let thecomputer solve the task programmatically.
